that lml(alpha, beta, Phi, Y)
that returns the log marginal likelihood, and also a function grad_lml(alpha, beta, Phi, Y)
that returns the gradient of the log marginal likelihood with respect to the vector (α,β). 2.
The function should return a numpy vector with the gradient with respect to α in the first component and gradient
with respect to β in the second.
